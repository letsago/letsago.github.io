## Yup It's Me!

I'm currently a software engineering intern at [Hyperspace XR](https://www.hyperspacexr.com/) where I work to make our virtual reality experiences more immersive. I'm a former data analyst with an applied physics/materials science education. I learned software development through guided self-study and the personal projects I completed below. For more info on my projects, check out my [Github](https://www.github.com/letsago)!

In my free time, I like to toy around with ideas of storytelling via visual media (aka I like watching films and online videos). One of my biggest hobbies is to create videos. Check some out on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/WoodOfTheSher)!

## Personal Projects

#### Roomba Simulation

To test my knowledge of data structures, I decided to build a virtual robot that traverses and cleans any rooms. Check out the image below to see the AI in action. All code was developed using C++. For further reference, click [here](https://github.com/letsago/Roomba/blob/master/Roomba/README.md) for the project's README.

#### Any Nearby Movie Showings?

As someone highly interested in films, I've wanted to build a tool that can conveniently show me what movies are playing nearby. Now, anyone can [find films](https://findfilms.yupatrick.com) in any nearby AMC theaters! For further reference, click [here](https://github.com/letsago/FindFilms/blob/master/FindFilms/README.md) for the project's README.

#### 80 Points Card Game

[80 Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji), also known as Tractor or Sheng Ji, is a popular Chinese card game not unlike Hearts or Spades. Back in high school and college, I often played this game with my friends but when we went our separate ways, we couldn't play with each other as often. Now, we can [play 80 Points](https://eightypoints.yupatrick.com) as often as we want! To see the codebase, click [here](https://github.com/letsago/80Points/blob/master/README.md) for the README.
